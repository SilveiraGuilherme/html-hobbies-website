          A look at the lives of the strong-willed women of the Weston family,
          whose paths have diverged until a family crisis brings them back to
          the Oklahoma house they grew up in, and to the dysfunctional woman who
          raised them.

          Violet Weston (Meryl Streep) has cancer and a propensity for pills and
          alcohol. She's a difficult woman to deal with and her husband has
          finally had enough. Violet's family gathers including middle daughter
          Ivy, youngest daughter Karen (with her new fianc√©), eldest daughter
          Barbara (with her separated husband and teenage daughter), and her
          sister Mattie Fae (with her husband and son in tow). A family tragedy
          causes tensions to run high and secrets to come out. The Weston women
          will be forced to examine themselves and their lives whether they want
          to or not. Welcome to Osage County, Oklahoma in the sweltering heat of
          August.
