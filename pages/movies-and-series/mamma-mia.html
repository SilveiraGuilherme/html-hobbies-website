        <summary>
          The story of a bride-to-be trying to find her real father told using
          hit songs by the popular 1970s group ABBA.
        </summary>
        <p>
          Set on a colorful Greek island, the plot serves as a background for a
          wealth of ABBA songs. A young woman about to be married discovers that
          any one of three men could be her father. She invites all three to the
          wedding without telling her mother, Donna Sheridan (Meryl Streep), who
          was once the lead singer of Donna and the Dynamos. In the meantime,
          Donna has invited her back-up singers, Rosie Mulligan (Dame Julie
          Walters) and Tanya Wilkinson (Christine Baranski).
