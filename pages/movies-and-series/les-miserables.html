        <summary>
          In 19th-century France, Jean Valjean, who for decades has been hunted
          by the ruthless policeman Javert after breaking parole, agrees to care
          for a factory worker's daughter. The decision changes their lives
          forever.
        </summary>
        <p>
          Jean Valjean, known as Prisoner 24601, is released from prison and
          breaks parole to create a new life for himself while evading the grip
          of the persistent Inspector Javert. Set in post-revolutionary France,
          the story reaches resolution against the background of the June
          Rebellion.
