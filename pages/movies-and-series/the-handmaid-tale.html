        <summary>
          Set in a dystopian future, a woman is forced to live as a concubine
          under a fundamentalist theocratic dictatorship.
        </summary>
        <p>
          A religion-based autocracy has taken over most of the United States,
          renaming the country Gilead. In this country women are second-class
          citizens. Anyone trying to escape is punished. One such person is
          June, who is captured while trying to escape with her husband and
          child and is sentenced to be a handmaid, bearing children for
          childless government officials. As a handmaid, June is renamed Offred.
          This is her story.
