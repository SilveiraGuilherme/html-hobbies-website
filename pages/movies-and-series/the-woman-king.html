          A historical epic inspired by true events that took place in The
          Kingdom of Dahomey, one of the most powerful states of Africa in the
          18th and 19th centuries.

        <p>
          The Woman King is the remarkable story of the Agojie, the all-female
          unit of warriors who protected the African Kingdom of Dahomey in the
          1800s with skills and a fierceness unlike anything the world has ever
          seen. Inspired by true events, The Woman King follows the emotionally
          epic journey of General Nanisca (OscarÂ®-winner Viola Davis) as she
          trains the next generation of recruits and readies them for battle
          against an enemy determined to destroy their way of life. Some things
          are worth fighting for.
