        <p>
          In a small town where everyone knows everyone, a peculiar incident
          starts a chain of events that leads to a child's disappearance, which
          begins to tear at the fabric of an otherwise-peaceful community. Dark
          government agencies and seemingly malevolent supernatural forces
          converge on the town, while a few of the locals begin to understand
          that more is going on than meets the eye.
