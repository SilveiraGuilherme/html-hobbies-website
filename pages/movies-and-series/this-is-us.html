        <summary>
          A heartwarming and emotional story about a unique set of triplets,
          their struggles and their wonderful parents.
        </summary>
        <p>
          Rebecca Pearson once had a difficult pregnancy with triplets. The
          resulting births occurred on the same day as her husband Jack
          Pearson's thirty-sixth birthday. The lives of Rebecca, Jack and their
          three offspring - Kevin, Kate and Randall - are presented at different
          points in time. The Rebecca and Jack stories generally take place
          during the early stage of their marriage, surrounding the birth of the
          three children or at different phases of the children's upbringing,
          which was not always smooth sailing for any of the five. Separate
          stories concerning Kevin, Kate and Randall are also presented in their
          adult years, each who has his or her own baggage resulting from that
          upbringing: Kevin who was generally the neglected one because he had
          no outward issues; Kate who has always had weight issues; Randall, the
          gifted one, being the visible outsider and being the "non-K" child.
          These stories may demonstrate the emotional ties that exist not only
          because of being family, but also because of four of them having the
          same birthday and some of them having always been together, meaning
          since conception.
